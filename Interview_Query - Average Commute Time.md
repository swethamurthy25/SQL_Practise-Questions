  ```SQL

    SELECT *,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_dt - start_dt))/60 AS commute_time
    FROM rides),

    SELECT commuter_id,
    FLOOR(AVG(commute_time)) AS avg_commuter_time

    WHERE city = 'NY'
    GROUP BY 1),
avg_all_commute_time AS (
    SELECT FLOOR(AVG(commute_time)) AS avg_time
    FROM commute_time
    WHERE city = 'NY')

SELECT 
a.commuter_id,
a.avg_commuter_time,
b.avg_time
FROM average_commuter_time a 
JOIN avg_all_commute_time b ON TRUE
ORDER BY 1
