Write a solution to report the employees' IDs with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:
* The employee's name is missing, or
* The employee's salary is missing.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

Things to be considered:
* If we do a left join, we may get only the rows on the left table or if we do a right join we may get rows on the right table
* But here we need to get all the tables' rows. So the best way is to use FULL OUTER JOIN or UNION
* First do left join on employees with salary as null and again do left join on salaries with name as null
* Then get the union of both queries.

```SQL
SELECT e.employee_id
FROM Employees e 
LEFT JOIN Salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.salary IS NULL
UNION
SELECT s.employee_id
FROM Salaries s 
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE e.name IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id
```
